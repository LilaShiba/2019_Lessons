# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

# The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as 
# the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants 


# If root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, we recur for left and right subtree. 
# The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in right subtree is the LCA. 
# If both keys lie in left subtree, then left subtree has LCA also, otherwise LCA lies in right subtree.
