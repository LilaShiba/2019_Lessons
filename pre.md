# Pro module: NoSQL

NoSQL (Not only Structured Query Language) is one of the data acquisition modules available after Foundations in the Core Track. It is an approach to handling unstructured data and structured data at scale that is growing in popularity.


## Learning Objectives

* Introduce the concepts, limitations and use-cases of both relational/ non-relational and structure/ unstructured databases.
* Discuss key database structures for NoSQL databases (document, wide-column, graph, key value pairs)
* Develop introductory skills to use Cassandra as a wide-column NoSQL database management tool
* Develop introductory skills to use Mongo as a document store NoSQL database management tool


**By the end of this module, learners will be able to:**

* Evaluate SQL, NoSQL and blended implementations for data storage solution by considering the type of data and scaling factors
* Evaluate database structures appropriate for different data storage problems (document, wide-column, graph, key value pairs)
* Create, read, update and delete data from a simple NoSQL database in a NoSQL database management system specific to the learner, e.g, Cassandra, Mongo, etc.
