### Deep blue algorithm name: 

alpha-beta search algorithm in parallel,Further improvement can be achieved without sacrificing accuracy by using ordering heuristics to search earlier parts of the tree that are likely to force alphaâ€“beta cutoffs.

#### Alpha Go algorithm name:

Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (random sampling employing minimal) to find its moves based on knowledge previously "learned" via a CNN to help guide the Monte Carlo algorithm.

#### GPU vs. CPU:
Moores law and GPU's to the rescue. Thanks ALU's and tensor cores.

GPUs: Problems which have a high arithmetic intensity and regular memory access patterns are typically easy(ier) to implement on GPUs, and perform well on them.
